# Planning motor control and high level behavior

## General requirements

Here are some general requirements that I will need from the code.

* There needs to be high level behaviors:
    - Search the maze until satisfied
    - Return to starting location
    - Navigate to goal
    - Look for alternate routes
    - Complete the maze data model
    - Go to location

* I need to be able to stop if I think I am going to hit a wall.

* Choose what kind of searching algorithm I am going to use.

* Need to concurrently and optionally share what I know or receive directions (BLE)


## Possible structures

I can have several tiers of logic like so:

Perception -> Interpretation -> Motor Control  -> Behaviors -> Mindsets


At the bottom, I have PERCEPTION:
* I automatically know how far I've moved, how fast I'm moving.
* I automatically know when I'm close or far from things.

Next to perception I have INTERPRETATION:
* This is fast

Next I have MOTOR CONTROL:
* I use my perception to do simple things like go straight, track, turn, rotate.
* I can also do slightly more complex things like rush to a place.

Next I have BEHAVIORS:
* What am I attempting to do at the moment?
* I want to explore, go to a place, go home, listen to commands.

Finally I have MINDSETS:
* Defines global goals that can be followed.
* I want to reach a location from a different location as fast as possible.

Perception and Motor Control are device specific, howeve behaviors and mindsets might be global.


## Implementations

Perception is so hardware level, it is entirely self regulating. 
You can poll values through interface functions such as:
* get_sensor_val()
* get_left_vel()
* get_left_diff()
* get left_acc()
* get_det_rr()


Motor control takes perception and allows us to do things like go straight.
Everything must be nonblocking.
