# Micromouse Milestones

Here is a list of software milestones that should be accomplished in a somewhat linear order.

1. Finish simple maze struct representation and tests to ensure functions work
2. Write maze parser so we can read a maze into memory from file for testing.
3. Finish maze simulator to show actual maze and next to "microvision".
4. Implement floodfill algorithm to return doubly-linked-list of nodes to visit to get from A to B coordinates.
5. Incorperate floodfill in simulation display
6. Setup main for selected PIC
7. Read and average values from sensors
8. Write DC motor control logic to drive straight forward with no correction.
9. Write P controller to change speed of motor in tests
10. Write I controller, integrate with P to make PI, drive down long straight
11. Write D controller, integrate with P for PD controller, drive down straight
12. Write atomic movements (90\* turn, 180 degree turn, flush against wall, drive x blocks)
